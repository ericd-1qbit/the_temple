# Supervised Learning
Formulate a problem as supervised learning if we have the following ingredients:
- examples with sets of features
- class label (target)

**Goal**: Find model which predicts accurately a class label given a new example.

**Classification**: Focus on **categorical labels** - predict probability of $x$ being in class $i$Â 

**Regression**: Predict mean value of continuous label $y$
