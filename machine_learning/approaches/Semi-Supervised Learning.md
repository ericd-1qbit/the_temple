## CWoLa - Classification without Labels

Sources
%- Presentation: {\verbatim /Users/drdre/Documents/MachineLearning/BOOST_CWoLa_Hunting.pdf}
Use Case:

- extended the bump hunting with ML
- classification problem unknown labels or class proportions
- or unreliable simulations with statistical mixtures of the classes available
- train directly on data

### Notes
- Need some variable X (e.g. mJJ) in which bg is smooth and signal is localized
- Need some other variables {Y} (e.g. jet substructure) which may provide discriminating power which may be a-priori unknown.
- {Y} should not be strongly correlated with X over the X-width of the signal.Or decorrelate (e.g. if we can predict or measure the correlation, that can be subtracted away to create new uncorrelated variables).
- optimal CWola classifier same classifier as in fully-supervised ML
- The problem of learning from unknown mixed samples can be shown to be mathematically equivalent to the problem of learning with asymmetric random label noise
