# Stable Diffusion & Latent Diffusion Models

- DM - image formation process can be seen as sequential application of denoising AEs
- guiding mechanisms can be used to control image generation process
- training and inference computationally expensive, as operations are done in input space (eg on pixels)
- main idea:
	- apply DM in latent space of powerful, pre-trained autoencoders
- Results:
	- reaching near-optimal
