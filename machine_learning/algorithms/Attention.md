attention is a concept borrowed from human cognition
- efficient use of resources
- facilitates the semantic understanding of raw sensory data
- the ability to register the environmental stimuli by processing and saving it in memory for future recall
- Visual Attention is a process of identifying salient objects/regions in the scene and registering them as potential meaningful stimulus helpful in achieving the goal
-  this is done in stages, each stage registering different feature levels of salient (important) objects
	- from low level - orientation, motion, color, intensity 
	- to high level - details of an object, eyes in a face etc.
	- these are summarised into an abstract representation - the **saliency map**
- same holds for text attention - building a saliency map of the most descriptive words in a given text.
