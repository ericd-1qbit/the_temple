## Q-Learning
  - model-free
  - Q - quality
  - goal: develop optimal policy for an agent
  - exploration (a random compo)
  - trying to learn a policy
  - Q-function solved iteratively
  - temporal difference equation - compare reward step t vs t+1
  - parameters: learning rate, discount, epsilon

### Bellman Equations
  - depends on state x, action a at timne t
  - also on reward R
  - Value is calculated depending opn prior rewards (gamma)
  - functional equation - solve the Q-function:w
