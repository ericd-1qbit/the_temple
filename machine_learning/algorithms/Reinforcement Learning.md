\section{Reinforcement Learning}

\begin{itemize}

  \item nop data is being used!

  \item an agent learns to perform an action on environment and receives rewards

  \item example algorithms: QLearning, DQN, SARSA

  \item jet grooming through reinforcement learning

  \item qbit control

\end{itemize}
