| Data Mining           | To automatically extract useful info from large datasets                          |
| Machine Learning      | Automatically detect patterns in data and use these to make predictions/decisions |
| Data                  | Collection of examples (samples, rows) and features (columns)                     |
| Generalisation        | Ability of an algorithm to perform on an unseen dataset                           |
| Features              | Variables describing certain characteristics of the input data                    |
| Feature Vector/Sample | One input data point instance                                                     |
| train/test error      | The error of the algorithm estimated on the training/testing dataset.             |

|   \item GAN - generate Ising model

  \item translate to QA??

  \item what's a feedforward NN backpropagation?

  \item I. Goodfellow has a great many taxonomies

  \item automatic differentiation - computing derivatives with se compuhda

  \item Recurrence: The output of a layer goes back to input.

  \item Hough transform: Image analysis technique which isolates features of a particular shape in an image.

  \item Dropout of 0.2 means 20\% of nodes in a layer are deactivated randomly    |
