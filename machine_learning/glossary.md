| Data Mining               | To automatically extract useful info from large datasets                            |
| Machine Learning          | Automatically detect patterns in data and use these to make predictions/decisions   |
| Data                      | Collection of examples (samples, rows) and features (columns)                       |
| Generalisation            | Ability of an algorithm to perform on an unseen dataset                             |
| Features                  | Variables describing certain characteristics of the input data                      |
| Feature Vector/Sample     | One input data point instance                                                       |
| train/test error          | The error of the algorithm estimated on the training/testing dataset.               |
| Automatic Differentiation | Numerical derivative computation                                                    |
| Recurrence                | Feeding a layers output back as input                                               |
| Hough transform           | Image analysis technique which isolates features of a particular shape in an image. |
| Dropout                          |  Dropout of $x$ means $x\%$ of nodes in a layer are deactivated.                                                                                   |
