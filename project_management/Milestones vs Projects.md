- milestones are:
	- small:
		-  (1-3 weeks)
		- multiple milestone = project
	- high-quality:
		- each milestone - improve things
		- at the end of milestone: stable version of code
	- understandable:
		- names according to delivered value
		- make understandable for business poeople & engineers
	- valuable:
		- each milestone delivers a value
		- stop midway through a project: still accumulation of valuable points
- milestone management instead of project management
- project estimation notoriously unreliable
- milestones are more easily manageable and provide inbetween states to take decisions from
- project breakdown:
	- high level plan: milestone breakdown of project
	- breaking down into technical tasks is too rigid
- come up with multiple ways to approach a project
	- consider trade-offs:
		- when does a product need to be delivered?
		- what information will be learned when?
		- when will work be fully integrated?
		- how much optionality is left open?
