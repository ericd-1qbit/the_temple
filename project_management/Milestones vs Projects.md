- milestones are:
	- small:

		- multiple milestone = project
	- high-quality:
		- each milestone - improve things
		- at the end of milestone: stable version of code
	- understandable:
		- names according to delivered value
		- make understandable for business poeople & engineers
	- valuable:
		- each milestone delivers a value
		- stop midway through a project: still accumulation of valuable points
- milestone management instead of project management
- project estimation notoriously unreliable
- milestones are more easily manageable and provide inbetween states to take decisions from
