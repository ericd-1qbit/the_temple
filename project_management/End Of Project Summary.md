##### Performance Analysis

- most important step of the whole project closure report
- dive deep into the budget:
	- compare the actual costs with baseline
	- schedule of the project with the set baseline. To be effective, the performance analysis has to be subdivided into three parts namely, the Goals and Objective Performance, the Success Criteria Performance and the Schedule and Budget Performance.

**i. Goals and Objectives Performance**

Before you began the project, in the project outline, what were the set goals and objectives for the project? What did you hope to have achieved by the end of the project? How many of those goals have actually been achieved? In addition, how many of those have had to be revised as the conditions on the ground changed?

The questions above are some of the key questions that should be asked when looking at the Goals and Objectives Performance Analysis of the project.

**ii. Success Criteria Performance**

The success Criteria is the one that deals directly with the KPI’s. One thing great project managers do before they embark on a new project is to define success before the project begins. The definition of success for a project can differ from one project to the next. Therefore, you have to look at how you defined the success of your project and check to see whether you got there.

**iii. Schedule and Budget Performance**

Lastly, under performance analysis, you will have to look at your [Schedule](https://www.projectpractical.com/8-steps-for-creating-a-project-schedule-that-drive-project-success/) and Budget Performance. On your project Scope, what were the set deadlines? Did you meet those deadlines? If not, what were the main reasons for the failure to meet the deadlines? The same questions will apply when you look at your budget. Was it enough or did you have to go to the bank or client for more funding?

In any case, the key thing would be to analyze and compare your actual performance with your set targets.


The performance analysis of the project is one of the most important parts of the report because it expands on the scope and provides information on the budget, schedule, objectives and success. Here are the main three sections you can include in this portion of the report:

1.  Goals and objective performance: This explains the initial goals of the project, how many of those goals you achieved and what objectives you adjusted during the course of the project.
    
2.  Success criteria performance: This section refers to your KPIs, performance metrics and how you defined success for this specific project. Explain how, when or if the project achieved its performance goals.
    
3.  Schedule and budget performance: You can describe the schedule and budget set for the project and if the team stayed within those limits in this section. If the team didn't stay within those limits, list the reasons why.

##### Project Highlights
Important Aspects Of The Project
The project Highlight Section looks at the highlights of the whole project throughout the whole timeline. It usually includes high-level project information such as the requests and any other issues that arose within the project.

Compiling the highlight report and adding it to the project closure report should not be hard. It is recommended that you should at least make a highlight report at the end of each week throughout the course of a project updating the different [stakeholders](https://www.projectpractical.com/stakeholder-management-strategy-and-how-to-develop-a-solid-plan/) involved in the project of the project’s current progress.

If you have those reports, then you can just refer to them and pick the key points from each of the weekly reports to combine them into one master report to include in your final Project Closure Report.

##### Challenges and Risks
Every Project has its challenges and [risks.](https://www.projectpractical.com/a-detailed-guide-to-prepare-a-risk-management-plan-free-template/) This section will enable you to highlight all the challenges that might have been faced throughout the course of the project. One thing about challenges especially in relation to projects and [project management](https://www.projectpractical.com/10-project-management-skills-all-project-managers-need-to-master/) is that they can be difficult to foresee. Apart from that, no matter how carefully you plan at the inception of the project, you can never plan around every potential challenge.

For future reference and presentation to stakeholders, you should use this section to highlight every challenge you faced throughout the course of the project. In addition to listing down the challenges, you should also highlight how the challenge affected other aspects of your project including your budget and schedule.

Besides the challenges, you should also highlight the risks faced. Risks can be anything from the weather, workplace safety, or even money. 

This section details the challenges and risks faced throughout the project timeline and includes information like how these challenges affected other areas of the project, such as the budget and timetable. You can also list risks, such as working conditions or budget limitations. This can be helpful for future reference when planning other projects.


##### Lessons learned
One source of valuable lessons for any project are the challenges. When you overcome the challenges faced when doing a process, chances are, you will learn one or two things. Use this section of your Project Closure Report to highlight what you learned.

During the course of the project, you will also be working with different stakeholders from different industries. Sometimes these stakeholders can teach you different techniques to help work get done faster which is valuable. If you learned such techniques from the various stakeholders you would have worked with throughout the project implementation, then you should use this section to highlight those lessons.

The reason why it’s important to note down the lessons learned in this project closing document is that later on when doing another project, you can always reference the report of your previous project to look for common pitfalls and how you can avoid those pitfalls.

Listing the challenges that the team overcame during the project and what members learned in the process can be helpful for future reference. Teams working on future projects can look at this information to avoid the same challenges. The team may also have learned tips from senior management or stakeholders, and including this information can be helpful to other teams.

##### Future Suggestions

The final part would be writing the recommendations. Recommendations can be anything from the proposed [improvements](https://www.projectpractical.com/10-business-process-improvement-best-practices/) to the maintenance schedule for the final product. In addition when writing the [lessons learned](https://www.projectpractical.com/12-steps-to-writing-an-effective-lessons-learned-report/), if there are some things on the lessons that affect the project directly, then such lessons should go with their recommendations for easy referencing.

- project management comments


You may also list future recommendations for implementing or completing projects based on the experiences of the project for which you're reporting. The team, project manager and stakeholders can find it useful to leave comments on the final product or deliverable. These recommendations can improve the overall completion and reception of other projects. Recommendations can include timeline suggestions, comments on the use of resources or budget adjustments for similar projects.

##### Financial Summary

The financial summary of the project closure report lists the cost of each resource, ongoing costs, the projected budget and the actual money spent. You can format this section as two tables separated by the resources' costs and ongoing costs to improve readability and effectively organize the project's financial information. The bottom of the table can also include a notes section to explain any variances in cost or additional reasons for requesting more funds if you needed them to complete the project.

##### Transfer of Operations/Delivery
You can describe the transfer of operations by listing ongoing tasks and how to transfer them to operations, including identifying operational roles. List each task and brief details related to it, the operations role, the name of the person in that role and the date of the transition. This section provides documentation for official records.

##### Project Closure Approval
The last step in creating a project closure report is requesting closure approval, where senior management and stakeholders can allow a project's official termination. You can also format this section as a table with sections, including labels for each role, spaces for signatures and the current date. This section is important because it signifies that all project management processes are complete and all relevant parties approve of the final product.
