# End of Project Summary
- should refer to any points made in [[Executive Summary]]

## Guidelines
- deliver your report as soon as possible after your project work is complete.
- make highlight report at end of each week of project
### Clarity

## Step-by-Step Guide
- tags
- costs=manpower, computing time

##### Document Label

- project's name
- the team's name
- name of its individual members
- the project manager's name
- the executive sponsors
- current date at the top of the document

- Rationale: 
	- organize many reports
	- help senior management identify the project specifics
	- listing responsibles - easier for follow ups

##### Project Overview
- summary statement: What is **this report** about, content
- general overview of the whole project - summary statement
	- brief description of **what** the project was about
	- purpose
	- what needed to be done during the project, required procedures
	- how was that actually done
- additionally: 
	- Opportunity/Problem
	- Goal and Objective
	- Success Criteria 
	- any risks or assumptions

##### Project scope
- scope of the project in realtion to schedule and cost
- documentation of specifics of the project from beginning to completion:
	- goals
	- deliverables
	- features
	- deadlines
	- the tasks
	- costs/ressources
- are there variances between targeted vs actual specifics listed above?

##### Results and Outcomes
- key performance indicators (KPI): 
	- client satisfaction
	- project cost
	- project quality
	- (reusability)
- how did the whole project perform wrt set KPI?

- level of performance 
- how to measure success?
- outcome targets vs achievements from hitting the targets
	- projected completion date vs actual
	- recount causes of postivie, negative deviations

##### Performance Analysis

- most important step of the whole project closure report
- dive deep into comparison to baseline:
	- compare the actual costs
	- schedule of the project
- can be subdivided into three parts namely:

###### Goals and Objectives Performance
- project outline: what were the set goals and objectives for the project?
- What did you hope to have achieved by the end of the project? 
- How many of those goals have actually been achieved?
- In addition, how many of those have had to be revised as the conditions on the ground changed?
- adjustment of goals

###### Success Criteria Performance

- deals directly with the KPI
- success crtieria need to be defined prior to project
- check whether success was achieved
- 

###### Schedule and Budget Performance

- schedule:
	- set deadlines vs actual
	- reasons for deviation
- budget:
	- target vs actual
	- reasons for deviation


##### Project Highlights
- highlights throughout the whole timeline
- high-level project information:
	- requests
	- issues
- pick key points of weekly highlight reports if created

##### Challenges and Risks
- challenges over the course of the project
	- could they have been mitigated?
	- how did they affect other aspects of the project (budget, schedule)
#TODO what could that be for 1qbit projects
- risks 

##### Lessons learned
- highlight what was learned 
	- in overvcoming challenges
	- techniques
- what was valuable, what was not?
- common pitfalls and how to avoid
- tips from clients, dealing with clients or other exterieur sources
	- technical knowledge on tools?

##### Future Suggestions

- recommendations about the final product
- proposed improvements, maintenance schedule
- can relate to any lesson mentioned previously
- comments on final product which might help with future projects
- suggestions from a project management perspective
	- timeline
	- budget adjustment
	- use of ressources

##### Financial Summary

The financial summary of the project closure report lists the cost of each resource, ongoing costs, the projected budget and the actual money spent. You can format this section as two tables separated by the resources' costs and ongoing costs to improve readability and effectively organize the project's financial information. The bottom of the table can also include a notes section to explain any variances in cost or additional reasons for requesting more funds if you needed them to complete the project.

##### Transfer of Operations/Delivery
You can describe the transfer of operations by listing ongoing tasks and how to transfer them to operations, including identifying operational roles. List each task and brief details related to it, the operations role, the name of the person in that role and the date of the transition. This section provides documentation for official records.

##### Project Closure Approval
The last step in creating a project closure report is requesting closure approval, where senior management and stakeholders can allow a project's official termination. You can also format this section as a table with sections, including labels for each role, spaces for signatures and the current date. This section is important because it signifies that all project management processes are complete and all relevant parties approve of the final product.
