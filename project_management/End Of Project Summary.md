##### Document Label

- project's name
- the team's name
- name of its individual members
- the project manager's name
- the executive sponsors
- current date at the top of the document

- Rationale: 
	- organize many reports
	- help senior management identify the project specifics
	- listing responsibles - easier for follow ups

##### Project Overview
- general overview of the whole project - summary statement
	- brief description of **what** the project was about
	- what needed to be done during the project
	- how was that actually done
- additionally: 
	- Opportunity/Problem,Goal, and Objective, Success Criteria and any risks or assumptions about the project.

On the other hand, the summary statement of the project in a Project Closure report will be looking at the overall summary of what’s in the report. One important thing to note is the key difference between the project overview and the summary statement. The overview is about the project, its scope, and the activities that were done and the summary statement is about the report itself and things contained in the report.
A project overview usually includes the project's purpose, the required procedures and how those procedures were followed. It also includes a brief look at the issue or opportunity that was addressed, the project objectives and success metrics. Your overview can also include a summary statement at the end that gives a general idea of what the report includes.


##### Project scope
This step is closely related to the above but independent in its own way when it comes to your project closure report. Defined, the project scope is the part of a project where you document the specific goals, deliverables, features, deadlines, and the tasks of a project. It looks at everything that’s needed to get a project through from beginning to completion. This part of the Project Closure Report will look at the overall [scope](https://www.projectpractical.com/10-steps-to-writing-a-project-scope-management-plan/) of the Project in relation to the actual project schedule and ultimately the cost.

When a Scope analysis is initially done, everything including the project costs is factored into the initial analysis. These figures, however, will vary and shift as the project goes which is why it’s important to do such a comparison of the actual vs the targeted costs to see whether you ended up going over budget or remained under budget.

A project's scope explains the specific goals, deliverables, features of the product or service, tasks and deadlines. It also describes everything that went into completing the project from beginning to end. You can analyze and compare the scope to the project's actual timeline and cost to see variances in deadlines, cost or resources. This portion of the report goes into more depth about the details of the project listed in the overview statement.

##### Results and Outcomes
Before you set out to do your project, chances are, you first wrote down your key performance and indicators and key targets. In addition to the KPI’s, another thing you probably had was outcome targets. On this section, the goal is to look at the whole project in relation to the Key Performance Indicators that you would have set and see the outcomes achieved from that.

What are the project outcomes? Project outcomes refer to the level of performance or achievement that would have occurred due to the activities of the teams on the project. However, measuring project outcomes correctly is not an easy task. There are three [metrics](https://www.projectpractical.com/5-ways-to-measure-project-success-what-metrics-to-use/) that you can use to determine if your project outcomes were positive or negative. The metrics are stakeholder satisfaction, project cost, and overall quality of the project.
In a section below the overview, you can explain what key performance indicators (KPIs) the team used to measure success, the outcome targets and any achievements from hitting those targets. Consider listing the outcome targets in a table that describes what the target was, the projected completion date and the actual completion date. This section analyzes the whole project in relation to these success metrics and recounts what caused each positive or negative outcome.

##### Performance Analysis

The project performance analysis can easily qualify as the most important step of the whole project closure report. The performance analysis expands on step 3 and really dives deep into the [budget](https://www.projectpractical.com/19-best-practices-to-keep-your-project-budget-under-control/) and compare the actual costs and schedule of the project with the set baseline. To be effective, the performance analysis has to be subdivided into three parts namely, the Goals and Objective Performance, the Success Criteria Performance and the Schedule and Budget Performance.

**i. Goals and Objectives Performance**

Before you began the project, in the project outline, what were the set goals and objectives for the project? What did you hope to have achieved by the end of the project? How many of those goals have actually been achieved? In addition, how many of those have had to be revised as the conditions on the ground changed?

The questions above are some of the key questions that should be asked when looking at the Goals and Objectives Performance Analysis of the project.

**ii. Success Criteria Performance**

The success Criteria is the one that deals directly with the KPI’s. One thing great project managers do before they embark on a new project is to define success before the project begins. The definition of success for a project can differ from one project to the next. Therefore, you have to look at how you defined the success of your project and check to see whether you got there.

**iii. Schedule and Budget Performance**

Lastly, under performance analysis, you will have to look at your [Schedule](https://www.projectpractical.com/8-steps-for-creating-a-project-schedule-that-drive-project-success/) and Budget Performance. On your project Scope, what were the set deadlines? Did you meet those deadlines? If not, what were the main reasons for the failure to meet the deadlines? The same questions will apply when you look at your budget. Was it enough or did you have to go to the bank or client for more funding?

In any case, the key thing would be to analyze and compare your actual performance with your set targets.


The performance analysis of the project is one of the most important parts of the report because it expands on the scope and provides information on the budget, schedule, objectives and success. Here are the main three sections you can include in this portion of the report:

1.  Goals and objective performance: This explains the initial goals of the project, how many of those goals you achieved and what objectives you adjusted during the course of the project.
    
2.  Success criteria performance: This section refers to your KPIs, performance metrics and how you defined success for this specific project. Explain how, when or if the project achieved its performance goals.
    
3.  Schedule and budget performance: You can describe the schedule and budget set for the project and if the team stayed within those limits in this section. If the team didn't stay within those limits, list the reasons why.

##### Project Highlights
Important Aspects Of The Project
The project Highlight Section looks at the highlights of the whole project throughout the whole timeline. It usually includes high-level project information such as the requests and any other issues that arose within the project.

Compiling the highlight report and adding it to the project closure report should not be hard. It is recommended that you should at least make a highlight report at the end of each week throughout the course of a project updating the different [stakeholders](https://www.projectpractical.com/stakeholder-management-strategy-and-how-to-develop-a-solid-plan/) involved in the project of the project’s current progress.

If you have those reports, then you can just refer to them and pick the key points from each of the weekly reports to combine them into one master report to include in your final Project Closure Report.

##### Challenges and Risks
Every Project has its challenges and [risks.](https://www.projectpractical.com/a-detailed-guide-to-prepare-a-risk-management-plan-free-template/) This section will enable you to highlight all the challenges that might have been faced throughout the course of the project. One thing about challenges especially in relation to projects and [project management](https://www.projectpractical.com/10-project-management-skills-all-project-managers-need-to-master/) is that they can be difficult to foresee. Apart from that, no matter how carefully you plan at the inception of the project, you can never plan around every potential challenge.

For future reference and presentation to stakeholders, you should use this section to highlight every challenge you faced throughout the course of the project. In addition to listing down the challenges, you should also highlight how the challenge affected other aspects of your project including your budget and schedule.

Besides the challenges, you should also highlight the risks faced. Risks can be anything from the weather, workplace safety, or even money. 

This section details the challenges and risks faced throughout the project timeline and includes information like how these challenges affected other areas of the project, such as the budget and timetable. You can also list risks, such as working conditions or budget limitations. This can be helpful for future reference when planning other projects.


##### Lessons learned
One source of valuable lessons for any project are the challenges. When you overcome the challenges faced when doing a process, chances are, you will learn one or two things. Use this section of your Project Closure Report to highlight what you learned.

During the course of the project, you will also be working with different stakeholders from different industries. Sometimes these stakeholders can teach you different techniques to help work get done faster which is valuable. If you learned such techniques from the various stakeholders you would have worked with throughout the project implementation, then you should use this section to highlight those lessons.

The reason why it’s important to note down the lessons learned in this project closing document is that later on when doing another project, you can always reference the report of your previous project to look for common pitfalls and how you can avoid those pitfalls.

Listing the challenges that the team overcame during the project and what members learned in the process can be helpful for future reference. Teams working on future projects can look at this information to avoid the same challenges. The team may also have learned tips from senior management or stakeholders, and including this information can be helpful to other teams.

##### Future Suggestions

The final part would be writing the recommendations. Recommendations can be anything from the proposed [improvements](https://www.projectpractical.com/10-business-process-improvement-best-practices/) to the maintenance schedule for the final product. In addition when writing the [lessons learned](https://www.projectpractical.com/12-steps-to-writing-an-effective-lessons-learned-report/), if there are some things on the lessons that affect the project directly, then such lessons should go with their recommendations for easy referencing.

- project management comments


You may also list future recommendations for implementing or completing projects based on the experiences of the project for which you're reporting. The team, project manager and stakeholders can find it useful to leave comments on the final product or deliverable. These recommendations can improve the overall completion and reception of other projects. Recommendations can include timeline suggestions, comments on the use of resources or budget adjustments for similar projects.

##### Financial Summary

The financial summary of the project closure report lists the cost of each resource, ongoing costs, the projected budget and the actual money spent. You can format this section as two tables separated by the resources' costs and ongoing costs to improve readability and effectively organize the project's financial information. The bottom of the table can also include a notes section to explain any variances in cost or additional reasons for requesting more funds if you needed them to complete the project.

##### Transfer of Operations/Delivery
You can describe the transfer of operations by listing ongoing tasks and how to transfer them to operations, including identifying operational roles. List each task and brief details related to it, the operations role, the name of the person in that role and the date of the transition. This section provides documentation for official records.

##### Project Closure Approval
The last step in creating a project closure report is requesting closure approval, where senior management and stakeholders can allow a project's official termination. You can also format this section as a table with sections, including labels for each role, spaces for signatures and the current date. This section is important because it signifies that all project management processes are complete and all relevant parties approve of the final product.
