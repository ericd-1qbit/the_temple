While goals and objectives work in harmony to maximise your business strategy and produce results, they have clear differences that must be recognised to use them effectively.  

**Goals are:**  

-   Broad in nature
-   Valuable for setting a general direction or vision
-   Difficult to measure
-   Abstract ideas
-   Longer term
-   The end result  
    

Examples of goals include:  

-   I want to become known as an expert in business strategy
-   I will commit to my career development and learn how to increase sales
-   I want to be more confident  
    

**Objectives are:**  

-   Narrow in scope
-   Specific steps
-   Associated with a schedule and time frame
-   The means to the end result
-   Easy to measure
-   Short term or medium term  
    

Examples of objectives include:  

-   I will speak at five conferences in the next year
-   I will read one book about sales strategy every month
-   I will work with a coach to practise my networking skills by the end of this month  
    

While goals create a vision with a wide range, objectives focus on the individual, achievable outcomes. Objectives are the concrete deliverables that make the goal come to life. Progress towards them helps measure advancement to reaching the larger end goal.

S.M.A.R.T goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely.
