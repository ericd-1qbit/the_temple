## Develop Leadership Skills
### Acquire Project Management Tools Overview
Done

Within the Diffusion Model project I have the chance to setup and maintain a JIRA kanban board at the moment. This is a good practice in using project management tools.

### Develop & Demonstrate ability to conduct research projects independently

-   Ongoing work on Diffusion Models offers the opportunity to conduct and guide scientific studies.
    
    
    Supervising the runtime studies we are doing as part of the Diffusion Model project by guiding the software dev team in the relevant studies. Great fun!! ;)

    
    Within the Diffusion model project I have freedom to explore what it means to conduct a research project. I will continue pushing this.
    
    The Autoembedder project, a spin-off of the Allianz MLDQ project, provided a good toy research project to demonstrate my ability to see a project independently through to the end.  
          
    **What it offered:**
    
    -   exploring a new ML architecture (autoembedder)
        
        -   in particular working with embedding layers
    -   learning to work with tensorflow on a low level
        
        -   writing custom models with custom train- and test-steps, metrics, callbacks
    -   getting familiar with modern ML workflows
        
        -   using google cloud computing and service account
        -   CML+DVC - github action based continuous integration
    -   exploring and choosing example datasets
        
    -   dealing with all aspects of a project, from conception and code design to finalising, visualising and documenting
        
    
    **What it did not offer:**
    
    -   designing a ML model myself; coming up with an idea for a ML problem on my own
    -   collaborative work
    -   managing/leading colleagues
    -   direct application or client interaction



## Build Technical Knowledgebase
The recent deep dive on Diffusion Models has opened up a lot of new avenues on energy based models, langevin dynamics etc.

Obstacles at the moment are to actually write up the things I have learned into the Obsidian vault created for this purpose. I will dedicate regular hours to this task.
