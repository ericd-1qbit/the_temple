1.Summarize your progress to-date. *

## Two sets of objectives have been articulated:

### General 
General career objectives have been set by me before starting with the Diffusion Models work and are neatly captured in Lattice.
They are grouped under "Roadmap to becoming a CEO" (watch out, Andrew! haha) and include the main goals:
- Develop Leadership Skills
	- Develop & Demonstrate ability to conduct research projects independently
		- Ongoing work on Diffusion Models offers the opportunity to conduct and guide scientific studies.
		- I created the Autoembedder project, a spin-off of the Allianz MLDQ project, provided a good toy research project to demonstrate my ability to see a project independently through to the end.
	- Acquire Project Management Tools Overview
		- Having used different tools to manage projects, I feel confident in the usage of these and understand what is needed, convenient and overkill. 
- Build Technical Knowledgebase
	- Establish and Follow News Feed on Quantum Computing
	- Using Obsidian Vault Knowledgebase tool I am working on an overview of Machine Learning and Modern Computing Technologies. I chose this tool such that my knowledge base can be shared in the future with other colleagues (simple md files.)
	- The recent deep dive on Diffusion Models has opened up a lot of new avenues on energy based models, langevin dynamics etc.
	- Obstacles at the moment are to actually write up the things I have learned into the Obsidian vault created for this purpose. I will dedicate regular hours to this task.
- Deepen Understanding of Business World
	- Build Understanding how to get from Idea to Start-up
	- Investigate what drives business decisions
	- Illuminate the connection of companies to investors/VC/capital
	- I am in the process of digesting Ray Dalio's book "Principles" which offers a broad perspective on life & work and leadership.
	- Ehsan has offered some interesting conversation bits on start-ups. Looking forward to continuing this chat.

### Specific to reach seniority in my position at 1Qbit
The original objectives to advance my position within 1Qbit in context of the Diffusion Models project were formulated as follows:
> - Mentoring other junior members of the team and provide technical feedback on their daily challenges
>- Show technical ability in understanding complex states-of-the-art generative models, provide fast and reliable prototyping of the existing research
>- Contributing and leading the technical work in reproducing the results from the latest generative model research
>- Provide technical inputs for training large ML models
>- Taking initiative to explore the bottleneck of the existing workflow, coming up with potential solutions, in particular independently create tasks in the backlog and being able to propose concrete timeline to tackle the tasks efficiently

For ease of summarising, I reformulated this into these categories:

#### Mentoring & Project Management

- I am pro-actively supporting my team members in solving questions around git, python, Machine Learning libraries like jax and anything project related. I do this by either chatting with my team members through Zoom or providing write-ups on specific topics in Slack or Confluence. Examples of such feedback include: git merge issues, python design choices, test driven development, project management tools, jax infrastructure and usage, google cloud issues.
- Using the project board, I created multiple project plans to tackle large tasks specifically:
	- jax implementation. This was very successful, my colleague and me were chiseling away task after task, fully aligned with the time estimate.
	- JIT translation of the Diffusion Model: This is an ongoing collaboration with the software team.

#### ML Research Work
- My research work has mostly been focussed on technical aspects of training ML models - from runtime studies in multi-GPU settings to model implementations in state of the art libraries. 
- I would like to strengthen my research into the mathematical, structural and algorithmic approaches of the models themselves by acquiring a better overview of Diffusion Models in all their variations.

#### Technical Work
- The focus of my work complex states-of-the-art generative models next to major contributions to our own framework include quick cross checks with other codebases and reviews of external libraries, coding examples and model implementations.
- It does not include the in-depth review of relevant scientific papers, the mathematical body or the translation of a mathematical expression to code. 
- I am constantly trying to share and demonstrate insights on clean coding I acquired through experience or reading.
- By using our github project board I regularly contribute to the planning and proceedings of our technical work. 
- A large chunk of my energy recently went into improving the runtime of our code. While  improvements O(10%) have been made, the ongoing work on jax and jit will lead to more significant improvements.



2.If applicable, identify relevant project managers/leaders that can speak to your progress on certain skills/behaviours.
- Ehsan Zahedinjiad (ongoing work on Diffusion Models, daily contact)
- Clemens Adolphs (prior to starting on Diffusion Models)


3.You're 6 months into the year, what priorities do you need to set (including competencies/skills you want to develop) so that you successfully achieve your objectives by year end? *

I would like to make time for exploring certain aspects of Machine Learning Research deeper. I hope to be able to contribute to the discussions between our Applied team and HIL in the future.
Furthermore, I feel that I am not following up on my General goals as diligently as prior to starting the DM project. While this is no surprise, considering the more intense work, I would still like to find a balance with that going forward.


4.What is the best way your manager can support you in achieving your objectives? 

I would like to create more time for the points mentioned in the above notes. Delegating tasks and reducing the amount of time spent in "rabbit holes" of technical issues will help with this. Support-wise, I would like to feel re-assured that it is welcome for me to follow with the more General tasks (of course, depending on where the project is at). 
Otherwise, I feel great when work has a good balance between technical, management, research and organising tasks and there is some freedom to think.
