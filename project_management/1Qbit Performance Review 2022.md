1.Summarize your progress to-date. *

Two sets of objectives have been articulated:

- General (by myself)



- specific to reach seniority in my position
	The original objectives were formulated as follows:
	- Mentoring other junior members of the team and provide technical feedback on their daily challenges
	- Show technical ability in understanding complex states-of-the-art generative models, provide fast and reliable prototyping of the existing research
	- Contributing and leading the technical work in reproducing the results from the latest generative model research
	- Provide technical inputs for training large ML models
	- Taking initiative to explore the bottleneck of the existing workflow, coming up with potential solutions, in particular independently create tasks in the backlog and being able to propose concrete timeline to tackle the tasks efficiently

Mentoring & Project Management

- I am pro-actively supporting my team members in solving questions around git, python, Machine Learning libraries like jax and anything project related. I do this by either chatting with my team members through Zoom or providing write-ups on specific topics in Slack or Confluence.
- Examples of such feedback include: git merge issues, python design choices, test driven development, project management tools, jax infrastructure and usage.
		
ML Research Work

Technical Work
- The focus of my work complex states-of-the-art generative models next to major contributions to our own framework include quick cross checks with other codebases and reviews of external libraries, coding examples and model implementations.
- It does not include the in-depth review of relevant scientific papers, the mathematical body or the translation of a mathematical expression to code. 
- I am constantly trying to share and demonstrate insights on clean coding I acquired through experience or reading 
- By using our github project board I regularly contribute to the planning and proceedings of our technical work. 




2.If applicable, identify relevant project managers/leaders that can speak to your progress on certain skills/behaviours.
- Ehsan Zahedinjiad
- Clemens Adolphs


3.You're 6 months into the year, what priorities do you need to set (including competencies/skills you want to develop) so that you successfully achieve your objectives by year end? *


4.What is the best way your manager can support you in achieving your objectives? *



# Roadmap to becoming a CEO
## Define Long-Term Career Goals
- Partake in QuantumBC workshop on Quantum Machine Learning (January)
- Advance position within 1Qbit ongoing

## Develop Leadership Skills
### Acquire Project Management Tools Overview

Within the Diffusion Model project I have the chance to setup and maintain a JIRA kanban board at the moment. This is a good practice in using project management tools.

### Develop & Demonstrate ability to conduct research projects independently

-   Ongoing work on Diffusion Models offers the opportunity to conduct and guide scientific studies.
    
    
    Supervising the runtime studies we are doing as part of the Diffusion Model project by guiding the software dev team in the relevant studies. Great fun!! ;)

    
    Within the Diffusion model project I have freedom to explore what it means to conduct a research project. I will continue pushing this.
    
    The Autoembedder project, a spin-off of the Allianz MLDQ project, provided a good toy research project to demonstrate my ability to see a project independently through to the end.  
          
    **What it offered:**
    
    -   exploring a new ML architecture (autoembedder)
        
        -   in particular working with embedding layers
    -   learning to work with tensorflow on a low level
        
        -   writing custom models with custom train- and test-steps, metrics, callbacks
    -   getting familiar with modern ML workflows
        
        -   using google cloud computing and service account
        -   CML+DVC - github action based continuous integration
    -   exploring and choosing example datasets
        
    -   dealing with all aspects of a project, from conception and code design to finalising, visualising and documenting
        
    
    **What it did not offer:**
    
    -   designing a ML model myself; coming up with an idea for a ML problem on my own
    -   collaborative work
    -   managing/leading colleagues
    -   direct application or client interaction



## Build Technical Knowledgebase
The recent deep dive on Diffusion Models has opened up a lot of new avenues on energy based models, langevin dynamics etc.

Obstacles at the moment are to actually write up the things I have learned into the Obsidian vault created for this purpose. I will dedicate regular hours to this task.

KEY RESULT

## Deepen Understanding of Business World
KEY RESULT
Build Understanding how to get from Idea to Start-up
Investigate what drives business decisions
Illuminate the connection of companies to investors/VC/capital

In the process of digesting Ray Dalio's book "Principles" which offers a broad perspective on life & work, specifically related to Bridgewater.
