Summarize your progress on your 2021 objectives and to what extent you think you met your goals. What were your major contributions to 1QBit in 2021?


**General Objective: Major Contribution to a project with Clients**  
_Contribute to MLDQ project with Allianz._  
  

After an initial ramp-up phase of learning how the workflow at 1Qbit for this project looks like, I felt confident and enthusiastic in contributing to the project. I invested many work-hours to help shaping the product (code), providing visualisations for the results and trying out new, technical tools (like the dvc workflow). Next to the necessary technical nitty-gritty work, I was able to explore new algorithms (our anomaly detection approaches, the autoembedding framework) and machine learning frameworks (my first complex tensorflow application).  
On the regular, I took detailed minutes for our weekly meeting with Allianz, where I also partook in the discussions wherever possible. Towards the end of the project I presented the autoembedder model to Allianz.  
Reflecting on this, I feel I succeeded in this objective and enjoyed the process and the project itself.  
  

**Technical Objective: Catch Up on Clean Coding and Time Management standards**  
_Learn about clean coding standards, improve Coding Quality and review productivity techniques._  
  

I met this objective after a few weeks of technical work on my first project by following the guidelines laid out in the "Clean Coding" book by R. Martin and learning from the many useful comments received in Pull Request reviews.  
Adhering to these standards and further improve the cleanliness of the complete technical workflow is an objective for 2022.  
  

As I was already using GTD for my time/project management, I was able to quickly catch up with a few new additions to my system like time-sectors and prioritization. I quickly picked up on the usage of Lattice, which was new to me and formulated (and then re-formulated) my objectives. Clearly articulating objectives and career development steps will be a goal for 2022.  
  

**Community Objective: Becoming a part of the 1QBit community**  
_Connect with & help out colleagues, learn about the company._  
  

After getting to know some of my colleagues, I tried to understand how I could possibly help out with my expertise and network. I helped Einar to connect with my network for his PhD programme. I actively participated in our MLQIO meetings and enjoyed chats with colleagues outside of the work projects.  
Furthermore, I advertised upcoming workshops and seminars in our Slack workspace; something I plan to continue in the future.  
  

**Career Development/Outreach Objective: Staying in touch with Academic Quantum Computing Networks**  
_Partake in workshops & events and represent 1QBit._  
  

It is important to me to stay connected to some of the initiatives I was involved in in my previous position. This was met with positive resonance from 1QBit, which is great! I was able to chat with Andrew Fursman in preparation of my workshop and received helpful input from Clemens, Elisabetta and Ehsan.  
The workshop itself was successful, I received very interested questions in the panel discussion and learned a lot during the poster session, acting as a judge.  
  
Summarize your employee’s progress on their objectives since the mid-year review and to what extent they met their goals. What were your employee’s major contributions to 1QBit in 2021?


Note: This review is not part of the official bonus cycle as unfortunately, Eric joined 1QBit after the cut-off date for 2021 bonuses. Still, having a quick review will be helpful in setting the stage for subsequent career discussions.  
  

Eric has successfully onboarded to 1QBit and shown great enthusiasm and skill in getting up to speed with his responsibilities. Without delay he was able to valuably contribute to our client project via code, ideas in discussions, taking care of project minutiae and being pleasant to work with. He has also presented this work in both client and internal meetings with great clarity and a good presentation style.  
  

On top of the major client project, Eric took steps to reach out to fellow coworkers to either learn more from them or help them out with his connections in the quantum computing space.  
  

He's shown great interest in deepening his coding skills even further and has a clear plan on how to achieve this

-   connecting with and helping out colleagues and bringing enthusiasm on the table :)


Which Guiding Principle did you most exemplify in 2021? Be as specific as you can

Whereas I think, I tackled all guiding principles to some extend, the Individual and Team Commitment might the most representative of my work since October. I did not shy away from doing the dirty work, fixing bugs and committing my energy to the success of the project - despite the rather difficult goal. I always fulfilled the tasks I had promised to work on. Wherever possible, I tried to share my knowledge and insights. Within the boundaries of our first project, I tried to find a balance between the team effort (developing the MLDQ tool) and more individual learnings (tensorflow + autoembedder).

Which Guiding Principle did your employee most exemplify in 2021? Be as specific as you can

Indeed, I think we all should strive to embody all the guiding principles. Eric has had good showings in all of them and for this review wants to highlight the Individual and Team Commitment principle. There were indeed many concrete examples of this principle in action when it came to working on our Allianz machine learning project pushing the team objective forward while also managing his own learning and contributions.
How did you progress in meeting your development/career goals? In what ways did you improve or learn in 2021?

I progressed in my goals by:  
  

-   reaching out to my colleagues and network
-   reading up specific topics in relevant literature
-   receiving & incorporating feedback
-   reflecting on my week's work
-   asking colleagues when problems arose

  

I feel that I understand the workflow at 1QBit much better than when I started, feel confident to reach out to colleagues and contribute to the company's mission. Much of my learning was hands-on and not shying away from interactions and pushing myself towards new shores.


How did your employee progress in meeting their own development/career goals? In what ways did this employee improve or learn in 2021?

In the self-review Eric explains the _how_ in progressing towards his career goals. Let me summarize here some of the what. The first career goal of course was to pass the probationary period, which he did with flying colors (there was never a doubt during the first three month that we wouldn't want him to continue at 1QBit). By being attentive to feedback in code reviews and in our 1:1s Eric quickly picked up on the things he needed to brush up on or work towards and then took self-directed steps to get there.
