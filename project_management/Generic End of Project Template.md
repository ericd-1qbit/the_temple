- how did the whole project perform wrt set KPI?

- level of performance 
- how to measure success?

	- projected completion date vs actual
	- recount causes of postivie, negative deviations

##### Performance Analysis

- most important step of the whole project closure report
- dive deep into comparison to baseline:
	- compare the actual costs
	- schedule of the project
- can be subdivided into three parts namely:

###### Goals and Objectives Performance
- project outline: what were the set goals and objectives for the project?
- What did you hope to have achieved by the end of the project? 
- How many of those goals have actually been achieved?
- In addition, how many of those have had to be revised as the conditions on the ground changed?
- adjustment of goals

###### Success Criteria Performance

- deals directly with the KPI
- success crtieria need to be defined prior to project
- check whether success was achieved 

###### Schedule and Budget Performance

- schedule:
	- set deadlines vs actual
	- reasons for deviation
- budget:
	- target vs actual
	- reasons for deviation


##### Project Highlights
- highlights throughout the whole timeline
- high-level project information:
	- requests
	- issues
- pick key points of weekly highlight reports if created

##### Challenges and Risks
- challenges over the course of the project
	- could they have been mitigated?
	- how did they affect other aspects of the project (budget, schedule)
#TODO what could that be for 1qbit projects
- risks 

##### Lessons learned

	- in overvcoming challenges
	- techniques
- what was valuable, what was not?
- common pitfalls and how to avoid
- tips from clients, dealing with clients or other exterieur sources

- proposed improvements, maintenance schedule
- can relate to any lesson mentioned previously
- comments on final product which might help with future projects
- suggestions from a project management perspective
	- timeline
	- budget adjustment
	- use of ressources

##### Financial Summary

- cost of each resource
- ongoing costs
- the projected budget
- actual money spent
	- maybe use table format

##### Transfer of Operations/Delivery

	- ongoing tasks and how to transfer them to operations
	- including identifying operational roles, names
	- date of transition
	- List each task and brief details related to it
	- the operations role, the name of the person in that role and the date of the transition. 
- documentation for official records.

##### Project Closure Approval
- requesting closure approval - allow a project's official termination
- signify all project management processes are complete 
- all relevant parties approve of the final product.

##### Appendices
- relevant documents

# Executive Summary     

_This section should include a brief overview of the project, highlight key project performance ratings and highlights, summarize the key lessons learned, and next steps or remaining actions._ 

[Insert Executive Summary]

# Stakeholder Feedback

## Process

_This section should include a description of how feedback was/is being collected for lessons learned, who feedback was collected from (if specific groups were not targeted for feedback they should be mentioned as well with a reason why they were excluded), and the measures against success criteria (including stakeholder satisfaction)._

[Insert summary of feedback process]

## Feedback Results

_Include the results of the stakeholder feedback, including key (1 or 2) themes, key (1-3) things that were done well, key (1-3) opportunities for improvement for the future, and next steps.  This information should be summarized from the closure survey, lessons learned report, and success criteria measurements._

[insert feedback results]

# Project Performance Outcome

_This section should document the outcome of the project by comparing the outcome to the success criteria stated in the charter (or the approved changed success criteria documented in the Project Management Plan) and explain any variances._ [_Success_](https://uwaterloo.ca/ist-project-management-office/methodologies/project-management/project-success) _is based upon whether the project_
_delivered what was asked for, whether there are benefits to what was delivered, and the process to get there. If success criteria haven’t been defined up front for the project, the PMO is available for guidance._

_In the chart below, record the success criteria (from project management plan), expected results (from project management plan), actual results, variance & explanation, and a rating indicating how well the success for each category was met/not met.  The measurements for determining the actual results will be documented in the charter or project management plan.  The rating should be a collaborative agreement between the Project Manager and Sponsor, at minimum, and may also include feedback from project governance, the project team, and other stakeholders from the closure survey and other discussions._
