## Feedback Results

_Include the results of the stakeholder feedback, including key (1 or 2) themes, key (1-3) things that were done well, key (1-3) opportunities for improvement for the future, and next steps.  This information should be summarized from the closure survey, lessons learned report, and success criteria measurements._

# Project Performance Outcome

_This section should document the outcome of the project by comparing the outcome to the success criteria stated in the charter (or the approved changed success criteria documented in the Project Management Plan) and explain any variances._ [_Success_](https://uwaterloo.ca/ist-project-management-office/methodologies/project-management/project-success) _is based upon whether the project_
_delivered what was asked for, whether there are benefits to what was delivered, and the process to get there. If success criteria haven’t been defined up front for the project, the PMO is available for guidance._

_In the chart below, record the success criteria (from project management plan), expected results (from project management plan), actual results, variance & explanation, and a rating indicating how well the success for each category was met/not met.  The measurements for determining the actual results will be documented in the charter or project management plan.  The rating should be a collaborative agreement between the Project Manager and Sponsor, at minimum, and may also include feedback from project governance, the project team, and other stakeholders from the closure survey and other discussions._
