# Estimation

- first figure out: how accurate does the estimate need to be?
- make your unit of estimate dependent on the duration:

- What's being asked exactly?
	- provide the scope - assumptions
- build a model of the project:
	- a rough idea which steps are required to achieve the results
- split the model into components
	- identify parameters which these components depend on
- give the parameters a value
	- concentrate on most impactful ones
- record estimates and keep track
## Project Specific Estimation
- use a range of values for the time estimate:
	- best case, worst case
	- **PERT**: Program Evaluation Review Technique
		- optimistic, most likely, pessimistic
		- can produce a lot of numbers, might not be the best
- incremental development:
	- repeat these steps with high granularity:
		- Check requirements  
		- Analyze risk (and prioritize riskiest items earlier) 
		- Design, implement, integrate  
		â€¢ Validate with the users
	- iterative process
