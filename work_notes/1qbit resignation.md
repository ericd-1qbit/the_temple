Dear Karen,

I am writing to resign from my position as Senior Machine Learning Scientist at 1QBit, effective immediately. Thank you for the opportunity to work with the team and the experiences I have gained here, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at 1qbit!

Please let me know whether there is any other information you need from my side.

All the best and hope to stay in touch,
 Eric Drechsler
