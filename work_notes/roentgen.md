## Metrics for Medical Image Evaluation

MS-SSMI
Multi-scale Structural Similarity Index Measure
https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/image/multi_scale_structural_similarity.html
Smaller MS-SSIM indicates higher intra-prompt image generation diversity.
-> diversity for a given label

FID Score IncepV3
Smaller FID indicates higher fidelity to the original images.
(fidelity: Genauigkeit)



While the general image appearance was visu- ally very similar to real CXR, some aspects like electrodes or other device components almost always contained un- realistic features (e.g. discontinuations or streaks), which made this distinction simple. In the majority of cases ra- diologists were thus able to confidently guess which image was true and which was synthetic.
