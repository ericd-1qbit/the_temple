Clemens is right, it's an international case competition. SFU is hosting it this year. Teams from all over the world will compete in two case competition. The competition is Management Information Systems(MIS) which technically falls under business studies but most of the teams will have students from variety of other areas. The main case this year is being sponsored by 1QBit. **The topic for the case competition is future possibilities of diffusion models.** They need experts from 1QBit to be the judges for our case and thats where we come-in. I have attached information sheet if you wanna take a look. If you need to take a closer look at the actual case, I can get you access to that as well but you won't necessarily need to do that to judge the case.

Main event:

Location: SFU Harbour Centre - Room 2250, Downtown Vancouver, 515 W. Hastings, V6B 5K3

* 2pm for 2:15pm start of judges briefing.

Parq Vancouver - Kitsilano Ballroom, 39 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6B 0R3 Doors open from 7:30pm, with seating at 8pm. Dress: Professional. The Organizing Committee are suggesting "celebration formal" but we'll all be coming from judging the presentations so there's unlikely to be opportunities for costume changes. There will be several speeches over the course of dinner, plus the awards at the end of the evening.
