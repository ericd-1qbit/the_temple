Clemens is right, it's an international case competition. SFU is hosting it this year. Teams from all over the world will compete in two case competition. The competition is Management Information Systems(MIS) which technically falls under business studies but most of the teams will have students from variety of other areas. The main case this year is being sponsored by 1QBit. **The topic for the case competition is future possibilities of diffusion models.** They need experts from 1QBit to be the judges for our case and thats where we come-in. I have attached information sheet if you wanna take a look. If you need to take a closer look at the actual case, I can get you access to that as well but you won't necessarily need to do that to judge the case.

Main event:

Location: SFU Harbour Centre - Room 2250, Downtown Vancouver, 515 W. Hastings, V6B 5K3 
Timing: 
* 2pm for 2:15pm start of judges briefing. 
* You and the other judges in your division will be taken to the presentation rooms at 2:45pm. 
* Presentations from the competing schools will begin at 3pm. 
* You will see five presentations. They are each 25 minutes in total, involving a 20 minute presentation period in which you can interrupt and ask questions, and then 5 minutes dedicated Q&A. 
* Three other industry judges will also be with you on the judging panel: 
* Brendan McCabe, Director, Enterprise Commercial Business - Western Canada, Microsoft *
* Hilary Sinclair, Senior Operational Excellence Lead, CIOVAN / Ledcor 
* Silviu Hinta, Director of Technology CIOVAN / Branchup 
* After all the presentations are complete, our Associate Dean, Peter Tingling will serve as a judging facilitator and help you and the other judges decide on a ranking of the presentations. Up to 40 minutes has been allocated for this at the end. 

* Once the deliberation is over we can head over to Parq Vancouver for the Awards Banquet.



Parq Vancouver - Kitsilano Ballroom, 39 Smithe Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6B 0R3 Doors open from 7:30pm, with seating at 8pm. Dress: Professional. The Organizing Committee are suggesting "celebration formal" but we'll all be coming from judging the presentations so there's unlikely to be opportunities for costume changes. There will be several speeches over the course of dinner, plus the awards at the end of the evening.

Judging note

This judging note is written to complement the 24 hour case. It provides a summary of the main elements that teams should include in their case presentations. As an open-ended case, there is no one clear correct answer. Teams are expected to use information from the case, along with their knowledge and creativity to address the challenges specified at the end of the case.

As a reminder, during the 24 hours of case deliberation, teams are permitted to conduct online research to develop and support their recommendations. Teams may therefore present data from additional sources, make assumptions, and present a wide range of recommendations. **During your deliberation, you should carefully consider the rationale and analysis underpinning these recommendations.**
