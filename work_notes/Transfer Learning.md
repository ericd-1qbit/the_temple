To enhance the findings of COVID-19 disease using our proposed deep learning model, DenseNet is used for this research. DenseNet as the name suggests the denser connections higher will be the accuracy. For our Deep Learning Model, the DenseNet-121 architecture have been used as the foundation and used pre-trained weights as the concept of Transfer Learning. Dense connections are essentially feed-forward networks, which is DenseNet’s main advantage over other networks (Zhang et al., 2021). The central concept of DenseNet is the feature reuse, which results in extremely compact versions. They intensify fea- ture propagation and also stimulate feature regeneration, and turn down the number of parameters which has improved our model’s accuracy faster. DenseNet makes the connectivity of each layer much easier by simply connecting every layer directly with each layer. DenseNets make use of the network’s capacity by reusing features. Also torchvision is used to build and train our deep learning model from scratch. DenseNet as the name suggests the denser connections higher will be the accuracy. Also a deep learning library PyTorch is used and torchvision which is a pre-trained data learning model which has a maximum of control across overfitting and it also enhances the optimization of results from the very first.


o identify the lung image scenario and its affected infection, two kinds of views have been selected which are Postero-anterior (PA) and Antero-posterior (AP). The Postero-anterior (PA) view is the chest X-ray which is covered from posterior to anterior side of the patient.
