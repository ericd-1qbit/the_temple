Two general commentsÂ ðŸ˜Š

1.  Shall we move the "datasets" directory under "src"?
2.  Shall we extract the CelebA, CIFAR10 and LSUN data sets into separate .py files as well?
3.  Please update the datasets module location in "tests/test_preprocess.py" as well

I agree with Shakib's comments.  
Adding to comment#2, also a separate .py file forÂ `BaseDataset`
