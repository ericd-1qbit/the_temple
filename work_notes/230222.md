STM 


## Milestones until March 3rd
- Prepare retraining of updated DM on train dataset split with oversampling, benchmark - Jay, Eric
	- run train/test split on Exaion
		- STM 50/50
		- cardiomegaly 80/20
		- normal 80/20
	- implement ability to use weightedrandomsample in dataloader
	- run benchmarks
		- Wednesday: test-benchmark with class conditioning
		- Weekend 24th-26th: DM training benchmark with class conditioning on cardiomegaly & STM, no oversampling, using train/test
		- 
- Prepare generation of synthetic image dataset, 5.5k, no pathology - Shakib
	- Create script to produce synthetiuc dataset with specific ratios
	- ability to specify ratios in the synthetic dataset
	- 
- Train & Evaluate Densenet classifier using new labelling - Anahita, Eric
	- add ability to run training on synthetic dataset
	- implement augmented dataset (real+synthetic)
	- add ability to run training on augmented dataset
	- 
- adjust new scripts
