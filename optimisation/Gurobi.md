 Gurobi is believed to be the best mixed integer programming solver out there right now
  It can solve more than just MIPs (in the talks below our ex-colleague will present on quantum...). There are a few serious drawbacks with Gurobi though, like porting complicated problems to some compatible formulation, and also the price (20K per seat per year if I remember correctly)
